### BlackjackProject

Welcome

### Overview
This program reads classes to create a blackjack game. The game's functionality includes the functionality of hit during a low dram and staying with a high hand.  The program implement methods and fields amoungst the classes and accesses them during the blackjack game. with different capabilities from a text file. The application prompts the user for their name and adds to them money value to their account for betting.  Thank you for using this application.

### BlackjackProject Application 
Week 4 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp. BlackjackProject Application is a comand-line game designed for the user to attempt to accumulate as much money as possible.

Technologies Used Java Eclipse Atom Git Terminal

### Lessons Learned 
This program stretched my programing designs to have the objects associated with Blackjack game to store more information about the game. In Objected Oriented programming, the approach of creating any lass and Objects to minimize as much data in main class is getting easier and easier.  While I  still have much to go, I am consciously encapsulation data, and structuring data, to prevent errors and attempting to have as few lines of codes as possible. Embracing Object Oriented Programming is challenging, however, I believe this style of program design have har fewer bugs.


### Attack Plan 
Building upon UML diagram given, my first approach was to find the fastest way to accomplish the goal of creating a command-line Blackjack.  This proved wasteful, as I wrote too much code that I ended up encapsulated later.  I then switched to Object Oriented programing and assigned values into each class and utilized inheritance.  This helped in the process of writing the code once and then giving properties to all players at the blackjack table.

###Wish List Additions
I would like to have more players at the Blackjack table. Currently, there is only the computer and the user. Also, implment extended rules of Blackjack such as splitting the cards to make multiple hands or multiple form of betting.

Overall, I'm happy with the project and its use of interfacing.
